The Coug-UV designs were provided by the NSWC in Panama City, FL. We our currently modifying these designs as we build several of these vehicles to be deployed in multi-agent missions for cooperative SLAM as our CoUGARs (Cooperative Underwater Group of Autonomous Robots) fleet. The Coug-UVs were provided by the NEEC grant and will be used to support our current terrain aided navigation project where the CoUGARs fleet work in cooperation with the WAM-V 8 to attempt to localize and map out reservoirs here in Utah.
