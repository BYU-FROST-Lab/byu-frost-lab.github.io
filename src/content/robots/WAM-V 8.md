Our WAM-V 8 by Marine Advanced Robotics is our surface vessel used to facilitate communication with our underwater vehicles while mapping new environments. The vehicle is equipped with inertial sensors, camera and an RTK GPS along with a roomy on board storage bay. Using its retractable sensor plate we can deploy a variety of underwater sensors used for a specific mission including a bathymetric profiling sonar, imaging sonar, DVL, underwater cameras and acoustic modems.

This vehicle supports our terrain aided navigation research and will serve as our sink vehicle when facilitating cooperative multi-agent missions.
