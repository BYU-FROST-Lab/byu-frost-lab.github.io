The BlueROV2 Heavy by Blue Robotics is a modular, remotely operated vehicle designed for inspection, mapping, and intervention tasks in challenging underwater environments. This platform supports precise maneuvering and station keeping while carrying a diverse suite of sensors. A high-definition camera provides visual feedback for piloting and inspection.

The vehicle is equipped with a forward-looking sonar for sensing and navigation in low-visibility conditions, as well as a 3D sonar for mapping and scene reconstruction. A Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) enables accurate velocity estimation and dead-reckoned navigation when GPS is unavailable, while an acoustic USBL modem provides positioning relative to a surface asset or other agents. Together, these sensors allow the BlueROV2 Heavy to operate beyond visual line-of-sight and support research and operations in underwater perception, navigation, and mapping. 

This platform has been used to explore the reefs and marine life of the coast of Hawaii providing insights to biology teams at BYU, BYU-Hawaii, and Kuleana Coral Restoration.
