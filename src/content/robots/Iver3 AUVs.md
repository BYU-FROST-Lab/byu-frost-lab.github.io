Our two Iver3 AUVs from L3-Harris Ocean Server enable us to perform regular testing and data collection in undersea environments upto 100m in depth.

In particular, these vehicles are (or will shortly be) outfitted with a variety of perceptual sensors including side-scan sonar, stereo RGB cameras, hyperspectral cameras, and a forward-facing echo-sounder. Navigational sensors include acoustic communications (for both data transmission and range/bearing information), GPS, a DVL, a compass, and a pressure sensor for depth.

These vehicles support research in a variety of directions including cross-modality localization, multi-agent cooperative SLAM/localization/mapping, reef mapping, and intelligent autonomous data collection.
