The MakeFlyEasy Fighter VTOL is a fixed-wing VTOL unmanned aerial vehicle purpose-built for efficient, long-endurance data collection. Its vertical take-off and landing capability removes the need for runways, while fixed-wing cruise efficiency enables extended coverage over large areas, making it ideal for operations in remote or space-constrained environments. Our modular payload system supports a range of sensors for mapping, inspection, and environmental monitoring, delivering reliable, high-quality data in a platform that is both operationally flexible and field-ready.
