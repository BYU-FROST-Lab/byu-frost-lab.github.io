#  About

Porter Mathews is an all-around nerd. When he’s relaxing, he’s often at home playing board games, video games, or card games. He enjoys good food, spending time with the people he’s close to, and diving into creative projects like modding games. He’s also a self-proclaimed space lover, drawn to almost anything with a sci-fi or space-themed angle.

Porter is passionate about robotics and dreams of turning science fiction robots into scientific reality. He plans to pursue a PhD in Robotics, motivated by challenging work at the intersection of math, complex problem solving, and building systems that function in the real world. He brings strong coding ability and a willingness to lead when needed, and he thrives in environments where curiosity, rigor, and ambition are valued.

# Research

He is currently assisting in the development of an autonomous wheelchair system by integrating sensors and wireless controls, building and testing in virtual simulation environments, and implementing the processing pipeline needed to interpret data and drive reliable behavior.
