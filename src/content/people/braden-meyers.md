# About
Braden Meyers is a first-year electrical engineering graduate student who graduated from Brigham Young University’s mechanical engineering program in 2025. His academic background is in mechanical systems, controls, and robotics. 

He enjoys hands-on personal projects that integrate hardware and software, including synchronized Christmas light displays, microcontroller-based systems, custom PCB design, and 3D printing. Outside of engineering, Braden enjoys spending time outdoors, trail running, and exploring new places.

# Research
Braden’s research focuses on **state estimation, navigation, and mapping for underwater autonomous vehicles (AUVs)**. His interests include multi-sensor fusion, and robust localization in GPS-denied environments.

As an undergraduate, he designed and modeled a low-cost autonomous underwater vehicle known as **CougUV**, intended to be easily manufactured and deployed for research and education. This platform was developed to support cooperative underwater navigation using a fleet of vehicles—referred to as **CoUGARs**—capable of communicating and sharing information to perform underwater terrain based navigation collaboratively.

His current work builds on this foundation by exploring estimation frameworks for underwater robotics, including inertial navigation, Doppler velocity log (DVL) integration, acoustic positioning, and simulation-to-hardware validation. He is particularly interested in bridging high-fidelity simulation environments with real-world robotic systems using ROS 2-based architectures.
