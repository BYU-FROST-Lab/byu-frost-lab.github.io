# About
Ryan Bartholomew is an undergraduate at Brigham Young University, studying Electrical Engineering with a Math minor. He is especially interested in modeling, optimization, and control of large-scale systems, particularly in healthcare applications. Upon graduating from BYU, he plans to pursue a Ph.D. in Robotics or Electrical Engineering.

Ryan enjoys spending his free time with his family — hiking, running, and playing "airplane" with his baby boy.

# Research
Ryan joined the FROST Lab in May 2025 and is currently leading research on optimal path-planning for multi-agent robot swarms in GPS-denied environments. Previously in the FROST Lab, Ryan worked on developing techniques combining AI algorithms for improved terrain and object classification on surface vessel robots.
