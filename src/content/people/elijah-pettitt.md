I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science from BYU. I am currently working towards a Masters in Mechanical Engineering with help from my advisor Brady Moon. My research interests are in robotics, controls, programming, and UAVs. While much of my time is spent working on classes and research, a lot of my focus is also on my family taking care of our new daughter Nicole. My wife and I enjoy playing spikeball when we get the chance but most often we just work out. I also really enjoy riding a homemade version of Zappata’s Water Hoverboard.
