Elijah Pettitt graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science from BYU. He is currently working towards a Masters in Mechanical Engineering with help from his advisor Brady Moon. His research interests are in robotics, controls, programming, and UAVs. He has taken multiple control classes and spent two semesters of research credit working on control of a pneumatic robotic arm. His current project involves path planning for eVTOL's and will extend to additional development of ROSflight by adding an eVTOL platform.

While much of his time is spent working on classes and research, a lot of his focus is also on his family and taking care of their new daughter Nicole. Him and his wife enjoy playing spikeball when they get the chance but most often just work out at their home gym. He also enjoys riding a homemade version of Zappata’s Water Hoverboard.
