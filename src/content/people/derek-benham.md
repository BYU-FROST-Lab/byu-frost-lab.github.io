Derek Benham is a PhD Candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department (est. July 2021), where his research focuses on the intersection of field robotics, computer vision, and robust state estimation. His dissertation work involves the development of a custom sensor platform designed to advance 3D scene graph research and maritime navigation.

Currently, Derek leads the lab’s Autonomous Surface Vessel projects, applying factor graphs and Invariant Extended Kalman Filters to enable autonomous localization in complex coastline environments. His technical interests span small autonomous systems with DOD implications.

From Kennewick, Washington, Derek loves Star Wars, 3D printing, 3D printing Star Wars props, and auto mechanics. He always has at least 2 side projects going on at any given time and can build anything. His go to de-stressing activities are basketball, the gym, video games or playing Legos with his kids.
