Aaron Newman is from Highland Utah. He has moved around a lot and lived in various states. His interests are as varied as the states he's lived in, as he has a variety of amateur interests including chess, piano, music production, drawing, writing, linguistics, psychology, coding, worldbuilding, Dungeons and Dragons, Magic the Gathering, and ultimate frisbee.

On observation, it would seem his favorite thing to do is to start personal projects only to never finish any of them, but his favorite thing to do is actually to learn.Aaron plans on pursuing a graduate degree in Robotics or Artificial Intelligence after graduating from BYU. He hopes to work in the Space industry and to hopefully work for NASA or be an astronaut one day.
