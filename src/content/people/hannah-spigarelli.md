# About
Hannah Spigarelli is an undergraduate at Brigham Young University, studying Computer Science. She is particularly interested in reinforcement learning and in enabling autonomous robotic systems to explore, navigate, and interact with humans. She plans to pursue a PhD in Robotics after graduating in April 2026.

From Northern Virginia, Hannah enjoys rock climbing, canyoneering, woodworking, and reading. She plans to one day bikepack across Europe. She currently acts as president of BYU's Women in Computer Science club.

# Research
Hannah joined the FROST Lab in August 2025. She is currently working on a new baseline dataset that will act as an updated replacement for the KTH and MIT campus dataset. This dataset contains floorplans scrapped from OpenStreetMap's extensive worldwide data. 

Hannah has also done a significant amount of autonomous navigation and computer vision work with the BYU Mars Rover team.
