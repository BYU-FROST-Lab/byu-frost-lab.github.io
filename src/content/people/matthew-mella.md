# About

Matt is fascinated with how robots can gather data on the world that help us make better decisions. He loves learning how concepts in math all connect to each other. He also enjoys spending time in the mountains and is scuba certified.



# Research

Matt is using drone imagery of orchards to build detailed 3D models of the trees. These models are used to track key features about each tree such as its number of buds, blossoms, fruit, and so on. This information can be given to farmers to intelligently treat and take care of their orchards in an efficient manner.
